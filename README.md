# POC ( AKA Polish Obstacle Course ) official website

## Origins
The Polish Obstacle Course or POC, was first played oversees in Poland, although the creater and date the game was first played is unknown. The Game was played predominantly on beaches were the lines were easily drawn in the sand, but was also played on playgrounds with the help of some chalk.

It was made popular in America on the streets of Jersey City in the years of 2003-2005, where Konrad Dudziak, a native of Poland and then current student, remembered a game his father showed him when he was young. After sharing the idea with Scott Holt, a fellow student, the course was drawn with chalk on the schoolyard, and played by a handful of friends.

## Rise and Fall
The game caught on and it became a school sensation and quickly was the game of choice at Saint Peter's Prep. Its boom in popularity followed an exponential growth pattern for 7 weeks until SPP dean's office officially banned the game, citing that students began being increasingly late to classes as a result of the game, and the game resulted in the ripping and tearing of school uniforms. The game was still played after school hours, of school property or in defiance of school orders for in the following years.

## The Name
"The Game" remained nameless for the first month. Students started calling it The "Polish Obstacle Course" to honor the game's origin, as well as describe the games simple design. Others referred to it simply as the "Cool Game Outside."
POC became the more common name at the end of the 2004 school year.

## The Course
The Course is made with straight line and "ears," making sure no part of the structure is completely enclosed. The ears are the only curved shapes on the course and serve to keep a player out of reach from the opposing team.

It is always drawn with the same basic design, although it's size is adjustable to suit the amount of players.
