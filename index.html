        The Polish Obstacle Course or POC, was first played oversees in Poland
        were it was called different names in different areas; one common name
        was &quot;Manso&quot;. The creator and date the game was first played is
        unknown. The Game was played most often on beaches, were the lines were
        easily drawn in the sand, and on playgrounds with the help of some
        chalk.

      <p style="color:#4c4c4c">
        It was made popular in America on the streets of Jersey City in the
        years of 2003-2005, where Konrad Dudziak, a native of Poland and then
        current student, remembered a game his father showed him when he was
        young. After sharing the idea with Scott Holt, a fellow student, they
        decided to give it a try. The course was drawn with chalk on the
        schoolyard, and played by a handful of friends.

          The game caught on and it became a school sensation and quickly was
          the game of choice at Saint Peter's Prep. Its boom in popularity
          followed an exponential growth pattern for 7 weeks until SPP dean's
          office officially banned the game, citing that students began being
          increasingly late to classes as a result of the game, and the game
          resulted in the ripping and tearing of school uniforms. The game was
          still played after school hours, of school property or in defiance of
          school orders for in the following years.

      </p>

      <p style="font-size:11.0pt; color:maroon">
        &quot;The Game&quot; remained nameless for the first month. Students
        started calling it The &quot;Polish Obstacle Course&quot; to honor the
        game's origin, as well as describe the games simple design. Others
        referred to it simply as the &quot;Cool Game Outside.&quot; POC became
        the more common name at the end of the 2004 school year.
